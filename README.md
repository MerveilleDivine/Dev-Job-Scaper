# Multi-Source Remote Developer Job Scraper

A powerful Python script that scrapes remote developer job listings across multiple popular remote job boards, consolidates the results, and exports them into a clean CSV file for easy browsing and analysis.

---

## Features

- Scrapes jobs from **7+ major remote developer job boards**, including:
  - RemoteOK
  - We Work Remotely
  - Remote.co
  - JustRemote.co
  - Remotive.io
  - Working Nomads
  - Jobspresso

- Filters jobs by user-specified keyword (e.g., "python", "react", "full stack")
- Extracts key job details: title, company, posting date, job link, and source site
- Deduplicates results to avoid repeated listings across sites
- Outputs results in a well-structured CSV file named `<keyword>_jobs.csv`
- Designed for ease of extension to add more sources or features

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourus/dev_Job_Scraper.git](https://github.com/MerveilleDivine/Dev-Job-Scaper.git)
   cd dev_job_scraper
````

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the scraper with the `--keyword` argument to specify the job search term:

```bash
python scraper.py --keyword python
```

This will search all supported job boards for remote developer jobs related to ‚Äúpython‚Äù and save the results to `python_jobs.csv`.

## Example Output

The CSV file contains columns:

| title            | company     | link                                                             | date       | source         |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Backend Engineer | Acme Corp   | [https://remoteok.com/12345](https://remoteok.com/12345)         | 2025-07-29 | RemoteOK       |
| Frontend Dev     | Startup XYZ | [https://weworkremotely.com/678](https://weworkremotely.com/678) | 2025-07-29 | WeWorkRemotely |
| ...              | ...         | ...                                                              | ...        | ...            |

## Extending the Scraper

* Add new job boards by implementing new scraping functions following existing patterns.
* Improve data cleaning and filtering (e.g., filter jobs posted in the last 7 days).
* Integrate with databases or job alert systems.
* Add CLI options for output formats (JSON, Excel, etc.).

---

## Limitations

* Some job boards use JavaScript or APIs that require authentication, limiting scraping ability.
* Site structure changes may break scrapers; maintenance required.
* No pagination implemented‚Äîscrapes only first page of results.
* Intended for educational and personal use respecting target sites' terms.
